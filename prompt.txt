I will give you the villa ID and the details of the villa (amenities, location, bedroom count, kitchen details, pool info, rules, extra features, etc.).
Using this information, create a clean Python dictionary in the following format:

{
  "id": <id_given_by_me>,
  "name": "Villa #<id>",
  "rooms": <number_of_bedrooms>,
  "pool": <true_or_false>,          # use true or false in lowercase
  "beachside": <true_or_false>,     # true only if villa is directly on the beach
  "type": ["Friends", "Family"],    # choose relevant categories based on info
  "description": "<one-line summary of the villa>",
  "amenities": [
      "Short, grouped, clean list of amenities",
      "Combine related points",
      "Remove duplicates",
      "Keep wording simple and consistent"
  ],
  "location": "<City/Area>",
  "images": [
      "images/villa<id>/1.jpeg",
      "images/villa<id>/2.jpeg",
      ...
  ]
}


Rules:

I will provide the ID, and you must use it for:

"id"

"name": "Villa #<id>"

Image folder path: "images/villa<id>/..."

Use lowercase true and false for boolean values.

The "description" must be a single line only.

Determine "pool" based on details (true/false).

Set "beachside": true ONLY if the villa is directly on the beach.
If it is “walkable distance”, use "beachside": false.

Group amenities logically and keep them concise.

Do not add any extra information that I did not provide.
